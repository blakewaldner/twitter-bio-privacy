# twitter-bio-privacy
Request-based Java application leveraging threads, API integration, HTML scraping, and OCR techniques to monitor and notify users of limited merchandise released via Twitter

Specifically, this project monitored:
- Twitter Bio changes
- Twitter Bio link changes
- Twitter profile header changes
- Twitter Privacy changes (ex. monitored twitter user switching their profile from public -> protected: usually indicated a release very soon while profile was protected, monitor would still be able to monitor changes with protected privacy enabled due to clever monitoring method)

Some files have been not included or information redacted (mainly those involving client's webhooks/monitored profiles) to protect privacy of previous clients

(Source code was lost with a hardware failure and recovered from a decompiling the program jar file, comments unavailable/some formatting may look odd)
